summary: "Technology and the markets that drive them are a threat to our humanity. We are increasingly pressured to behave individually and conform to binary measures in order to serve corrupt systems. We are finding our selves more isolated, polarised, and machine-like than ever.

Collective action is required to restore our humanity, health, and environment. Technology must be reprogrammed to support our humanity and connect us physically. Society must be remade to support peer-to-peer economies and reward cooperation."

The internet makes us more divided and extreme.

**Only by working together, socially, can we make our technology and the world a better place**. Humanity is a byproduct of that behaviour.

The early internet was a rejection of top-down broadcast media. The late internet has only made it more entrenched.

Our culture is composed more of mediated experiences than of directly lived ones.

Software engineers tend to see humans as the problem and technology as the solution. They are either developing interfaces to control us or artificial intelligences to replace us.

Certain internet platforms attempt to influence one type of behaviour on the spot (metrics) and another later (advertising follow-through). **The internet at its best is a rejection of this; it fosters our innate need for social organisation**.

Internet platforms that fall under this umbrella include those that are in the business of delivering people to the marketers instead of people to one another.

Advertisers (and thus the certain internet platforms) know that socially fulfilled people are not good targets—they need less money, experience less shame, behave less predictably, and act more autonomously.

We must avoid imposing our (artificial and flawed) idea of individualism onto other flora and fauna. **We are are interconnected amongst our respective species**.

Trees actually don’t compete for sunlight—they collaborate. Evaluation has raised them to behave as if they are part of the same interconnected being. This might sound strange, but we humans are similar; we attune to each others emotional states. Think of those YouTube clips of watching Friends with the laugh-track on and off; we naturally try to resonate with the crowd.

We humans are unique in that we can pass down knowledge through generations. We do this through our social, imitative, and language abilities.

Happiness is an incentive—not a goal—of social cohesiveness. Nature’s way of making us interact with others. The inverse is also true; depression and other illnesses increase as disconnection from social groups occurs.

“Being social may be the whole point”. **Connection, rapport, camaraderie—not to mention happiness—all occur while communicating**.

**Without a sense of community, we focus on personal gain over collective prosperity**. We elevate individualistic endeavours. Collective challenges such as the climate crisis are seen tackled accordingly; self-preservation.

The basis of sound mental health is the capacity for integration with others. Healthy people live in social groups.

Healthy socialising is a mix of autonomy and interdependency. Today’s prioritisation of professional advancement and personal consumption is too far on the autonomy side. The other side is conformity, which is problematic because of unsustainable obedience to a higher power. **People need to look to each other for social direction, not up**.

Humans are intrinsically social. Our technologies are not—they need to be moulded.

Detachment makes it easier for people to see other people as less than human and to commit previously unthinkable acts of violence.

Detachment removes collaborative urges and instead fosters a need to compete in the media landscape. A ‘battle for survival of the fittest meme’. The rise of the digital influencer.

Memes are infectious, and bypass our neocortex—the thinking part of our brain. They trigger our reptilian, fight-or-flight reactions. The most outrageous ones are shared more by their outraged opponents than their advocates. _Will conservative politics increase in dominance as the global climate worsens?_

Memes are used to attack and control us by exploiting our fear, anxiety, and rage. _Would a meme survive in a strong social group?_ They make it difficult to muster a collective defence; they discourage collaboration, consensus, or empathy.

Money was originally invented to enable marketplace transactions. Today, the acquisition of money in itself has become the goal—to store wealth. The marketplace is just a way to get money. The automobile was invented to make commutes more accessible. They (for their sales) have ended up shaping our geography so home and work have become even less accessible. **Human social engagement is at risk of experiencing a similar reversal: the value is in the social engagement—utilitarian applications must remain a medium**.

Employability as a purpose of education allows corporations to externalise the cost of employee training.

Spreadsheets, calculators, calendars, contact lists. These tools went from analog to digital—from tools we use into the environments in which we live.

Whoever controls media controls society.

We have a history of losing control of media and social revolutions. Punk goes from DIY, direct-action to a fashion trend to be sold. Digital technology goes from social empowerment to profit centres.

Going online went from an active choice to a constant state of being. The resulting disorientation is self-reinforcing. The more we are interrupted, the more disrupted we become. The more susceptible to manipulation we become.

Digital design is now orientated around generating behaviour change and habit formation in users. It is less about the users’ experiences—it’s more about the products’ experiences with the users.

Persuasive design is about giving the illusion of choice. Neutral looking interfaces ensure we accept limitations.

Digital advertising is not just about selling products. **The deeper objective is to have users behave more in consistently with their assigned consumer segment**. More conformity means more predictability. Platforms want to induce behaviour change.

Advertising-based platforms want us to conform to market segments. This is removing our diversity, creativity, and resiliency as a species.

Humanity has tended to play out in the 80/20 rule: 80% of people behave passively, 20% actively or creatively. Algorithms are eliminating the 20%. We are becoming less resistant, less interesting.

Internet of Things devices are like cheap printers; their payoff is not immediate. IOT devices are primarily for the network to learn about and predict our behaviours, and then place us in even more granular statistical segments.

**Our mechanomorphic culture is embracing a digital aesthetic that irons out anything uniquely human**. We have bled machine values of efficiency, productivity, and power into human values. Our societal aim is to operate faster, with higher outputs, and greater uniformity. The same bleeding has happened in the digital age; everything is data and we are processors. A stark contrast from our irregular, multi-faceted biology.

Drone pilots who operate remotely have higher rates of post-traumatic stress. This is likely due to the detachment of physical location and human contact; treating the job as a machine to be managed and leaving the humanity behind. Technology should only support humanity—not remove it.

The television environment was used to help people envision products in their lives, and thus helped make America a consumer culture. Internet platform environments are much more influential. We must recognise the pull and instead promote human connection.

The internet’s social and intellectual potential has so far been surrender to short-term market priorities, turning a human-centred medium into one for manipulation and extraction.

The internet reinforces its core element: the binary. It makes us take sides. It makes us lose our organic noise and quirks in order to transmit only in perfect fidelity. Human performance is seen as in impediment to pure data.

Technology has no implicit bias. We express ourselves and our market _through_ it. **Our capitalist operating system is what drives the inhumane technological agenda**.

Everything is optimised for capital. Growth continues through the virtual territory that digital technology provides.

Instead of bringing widespread prosperity, the digital economy has amplified the most extractive aspects of traditional capitalism.

Digital platforms allow for more spread (such as more musicians selling their music) but, through their architecture, end up promoting fewer options than their analog counterparts (i.e. FM radios or record store vs Spotify). The superstars get all the plays.

The only players that survive are artificially inflated companies. Small business is punished because it is not playing the long game based on scale and capital.

The economy can be a **commons; shared ownership and output encourage cooperation**. Not winter-takes-all, rather all-take-the-winnings. _Wikipedia is perhaps a good example of this_.

Employment is a fairly new concept. It replaced selling value with selling time. Humans became resources. Time is money.

**Jobs have reversed from the means to the end**. They do not guarantee that necessary work gets done. Instead, they are used to justify one’s share in the abundance.

**We shape our technologies at the moment of their conception, but from that point on they shape us**. We designed the telephone, but then the telephone shaped how we communicate and conducted business.

To a hammer, everything is a nail. To an AI, everything is a computational challenge. **We must not accept any technology as the default solution for our problems**. When we do, we end up trying to optimise ourselves for our machines instead of optimising our machines for us.

The singularity: the moment when computers make humans obsolete.

At its best, **art celebrates our unique human ability to embrace ambiguity** or paradox. The works of David Lynch or Shakespeare that defy convention. Art makes us consider new approaches and possibilities. It wakes us up instead of putting us to sleep.

Zadie Smith: the writer’s job is not to “tell us how somebody felt about something, it is to tell us how the world works”.

Conventional work plays to our fears driven by our society in the first place: uncertainty, boredom, and ambiguity. We ache for a satisfying resolution.

Weirdness is power. Eccentricity opens the grey area where mutations develop and innovations are born.

The forced-transparency inherent in digital culture has brought us imposed surveillance and inescapable exposure, but also gay marriage and cannabis reform.

Only recently have we changed our understand of time from circular to linear. Circular time promotes interdependency and demotes progress. **Historical, linear, time justifies the world as an imperfect work in progress. We can do violence now for a higher cause and future payoff**.

Wettiko: Native American name for a delusional belief that cannibalising the life force of others is a logical and morally upright way to live. An inability to see yourself as an interdependent part of the natural environment. Applied to European colonialists.

The wettiko beliefs have prevailed: **the society that emerged from aggressive extraction still uses the promise of a utopian future to justify continued exploitation**. We fail to see nature as a larger system of which we ourselves are part.

Our addiction to expansion and growth derive from our need for control. The dissatisfaction that results ultimately makes it more addictive to us.

We shouldn’t get rid of our technology; our smartphones, stock markets, cities. We should instead reconfigure them to serve our humanity and environment. **We must go with the current—through the rapids—active participation instead of resistance or passivity**.

Our problems require recognition of the realities of nature, human experience and emotion, yet we’re answering them with pure science. This is partly why the unemployed coal worker may feel patronised by environmentalism.

Imbalance occurs when people are understood as self-interested individuals in competition against one another for survival and dominance. Balance occurs when the individual’s needs are balanced with those of the collective.

**Corporations learned to stoke consumption by reinforcing our identities as individual consumers**.

Solidarity begins with location. When politics are local, issues cannot as easily be distorted. Analog, geographical collectivism is key.

An encounter should be grounded in the greater context of our shared humanity. The other person’s position ultimately always derives from some human sensibility. **Find that core humanity, resonate with it, and retrieve its essential truth**.

The people we disagree with are not the real problem. The greatest threats are the beliefs and institutions that separate us from one another. **We must retrieve whatever helps us reconnect to people and places**.

Co-ops help engender a value-driven society. Autonomous individuals work together toward shared goals.

We mistakenly treat the future as something to prepare for. The future is created through our actions in the present; a verb, a thing we do. Our future is indeterminate.
