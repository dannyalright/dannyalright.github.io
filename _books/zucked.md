summary: "This book reads largely as an alibi for McNamee. He notes times where he reaches out to executives to take action against bad actors."

Technology is a useful servant but a dangerous master.

Roger McNamee still owned (owns?) shares in Facebook as of writing this book.

Facebook had an opportunity to be the hero in their own story, similar to how Johnson & Johnson handled the Tylenol incident. Their biggest fault lies not in the original overreach but rather in how they first responded to its ramifications.

This book’s purpose is to galvanise the reader to action; equip them with the tools to identify technology that takes advantage of users and their data.

The architecture of platforms like Facebook benefit conservative politics. Emotional posts become viral much easier than intellectual ones. Example: the emotional, nationalistic pro-leave Brexit campaign.

Facebook has become many countries’ public square—where people share ideas and form opinions. It has changed us from citizens to consumers.

McNamee: “I had been a Silicon Valley insider for more than 20 years”. Also McNamee, a few sentences after: “I did not realise then that the technology of Silicon Valley had ventured into uncharted technology”.

Facebook is a product of its time. It could not have been built in earlier Silicon Valley due to lacking infrastructure and services.

McNamee apparently wasn’t aware of anti-patterns (behavioural modification techniques that promote addiction) being used at Facebook until as late as 2017.

McNamee’s 7th Law: datasets become geometrically more valuable when you combine them.

Facebook’s advertising model made it compelling for content creators to place their content directly on Facebook (organic reach) rather than their own site. Facebook became the social hub of the web.

McNamee‘s band has had a Facebook page and Facebook advertising since early days. His insights therefore are multifaceted.
