## Only apply CSS if JavaScript is enabled

I believe JavaScript should be opt-in. Icing on the cake.

Say you want JavaScript to decide when to turn a `div` from `opacity: 0` to `opacity: 1`. If the user does not have JavaScript enabled, that `div` will never be visible. That `opacity: 0` should therefore only be set _if_ JavaScript is enabled.

Here's the cleanest way I think to do that (within my opt-in approach described above):

```js
document.documentElement.className = "js"
```

That adds the class `js` to the root `html` element. Then, in your CSS:

```css
.js div {
    opacity: 0;
}
```

That `div` will only ever receive the `opacity: 0` if the root `html` tag has the class `js` applied to it.

See [this Sass tip](/cheatsheets/sass#break-out-of-the-nesting-structure) for how to reference a higher-up parent element within your nesting structure. That's how I apply these `.js` styles.
