## Work history

Most recently I was a Senior and then Staff Designer at Kickstarter, where I led the design for its iOS and Android applications. I also led design for Kickstarter's environmental work, including the <a href="{% link _work/environmental-resources-center.md %}">Environmental Resources Center</a>, and help design the project creation experience.

At ustwo, I helped create and foster projects with the likes of Facebook, Nike, Google, GE, AT&T, and the Office of the Mayor of New York City. The work we did for the Office of the Mayor of New York City went on to receive an Adobe Government Creativity Award in 2018.

At Facebook I helped the Design Tools team bring Origami to life; contributing software design and creating the internal and <a href="https://origami.design/tutorials" target="_blank">external learning experience</a> (tutorial videos, examples, and their interconnections) that live on today. I also worked on the Interfaces team at Facebook, where I created the company's first Origami component library and helped envision Facebook product UI changes.
