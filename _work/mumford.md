Located in the southern Yorke Peninsula of South Australia, RK & SA Mumford operate farmland that produces a variety of grain commodities. The business required a visual identity to express the brand to potential customers and solidify their position in the market.

I produced a wordmark and combination mark for Mumford to apply across livery, stationery, and their farming products. The combination mark was designed to break in half and flex across variable applications.
