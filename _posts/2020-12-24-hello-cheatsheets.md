Just a quick one to introduce [Cheatsheets](/cheatsheets): a new part of this site where I'll record anything that took me a while to find the answer to, and would probably take me a while again had I not done the recording. I've started cheatsheets for [Jekyll](/cheatsheets/jekyll), [Eleventy](/cheatsheets/eleventy), and [Intersection Observer](/cheatsheets/intersection-observer). It's not the neatest list nor is it the cleanest taxonomy. It'll have to do for now.

Jekyll (which this site currently runs on) seems to be [fading into obsolescence](https://github.com/github/pages-gem/issues/651). I'm wary of putting too much effort into the current site (beyond writing posts, which are easily transported) because of the sunk cost risk later on. In other words: I know I'll need to get off Jekyll eventually and want to make it as painless as possible to do so. Adding to the site architecture means more work later on.

I'm getting pretty good with [Eleventy](http://11ty.dev). Building [the Future Super site](https://github.com/futuresuper/website) on Eleventy is helping to build that muscle. How long until Eleventy follows in Jekyll's footsteps though? (Probably long enough to warrant the move. But still...)

I'll rip off the Band-Aid soon enough. Until then (as a general principle) I'm getting more okay with starting from nothing, then sprinkling on generators and frameworks when—and only when—they are necessary. Jeremy Keith [says it well](https://css-tricks.com/npm-ruin-dev/):

> Instead of reaching for all-singing all-dancing toolchain by default, I’m going to [start with a boring baseline](https://justmarkup.com/notes/2020-01-14-boring-by-default/). If and when that becomes too painful or unwieldy, then I’ll throw in a task manager. But every time I add a dependency, I’ll be limiting the lifespan of the project.
