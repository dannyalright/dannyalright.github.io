Stephen King in his memoir _On Writing_:

> ...sometimes you're doing good work when it feels like all you're managing is to shovel shit from a sitting position.

I think the inverse is also true; what I think is great is sometimes received with indifference.

Anyway. I'm feeling this disconnect a lot lately, on both ends. It's nice to hear that legends of their craft still experience it too.
