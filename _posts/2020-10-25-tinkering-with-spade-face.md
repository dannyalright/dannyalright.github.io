A sprained ankle on a rainy day mean I'm actually making good on [yesterday's plan](the-archie) to try [SPADE-FACE on RunwayML](https://app.runwayml.com/models/sree_harsha/SPADE-FACE).

Hereâ€™s what that's looking like:

<figure>

  <img data-src="https://ik.imagekit.io/dw/notes/tinkering-with-spade-face/spade-face-b.jpg" alt="A sketch of a face and its computer-generated result">
  <img data-src="https://ik.imagekit.io/dw/notes/tinkering-with-spade-face/spade-face-c.jpg" alt="A sketch of a face and its computer-generated result">
  <figcaption>Left: the 'segmentation' sketch input. Right: the computer-generated output.</figcaption>
</figure>

There were a couple versions that didn't work out so well. They were ones I sketched elsewhere and imported in via a PNG or JPG. Here's what I mean:

<figure>

Demonic.

You can see the difference in black; the prior versions are pure `#000000`. The imported, demonic, one has gone through some unwanted colour profile changes. Same deal with all other colours. Similar results with PNG where there should be less colour differences.

   <figcaption>Each of these hex codes must be matched exactly for the model to do its magic.</figcaption>
</figure>

I had an idea to outsource the sketch creation to a whole bunch of people, ideally hand-rendered in crayon, marker, or acyclic. How would the output from a five year old kid in the U.S. differ from that of an adult in Sydney?

This colour matching snafu puts a damper on these plans as it means the segmentation sketch must be done in RunwayML or have been exported with the exact right colours and colour profile. That stuff is a black hole.

Anyway. There's gotta be a way. I'll figure something out.

Here's a speedrun of live-editing a segmentation:

And here's me learning how to chain models on RunwayML:
