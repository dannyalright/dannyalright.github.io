Last Friday was my last day at ustwo. After a few years there, and a range of agency experiences elsewhere, I’ve decided to take a step away from client services.

ustwo was (and still is) a special place. Gut-wrenching to leave. Some personal highlights:

* The [fampany](https://medium.com/offscreen-revisited/the-only-deep-true-interview-with-matt-mills-miller-co-founder-of-ustwo-7afe581b9931). As much flack as we give the thing, it did feel like a big ol' family
* Ana's empanadas
* Broken clocks, glass walls, and hoverboards
* Pecha Kuchas

The structure of ustwo (fampany etc) meant I had serious autonomy at ustwo. Using LittleBits in the design process, augmenting a games team, and hosting Framer Sessions were all easy to do and encouraged. The flat nature of ustwo also forced some skills to develop I wouldn’t have elsewhere.

Later this month I’ll be going in-house: joining the mobile apps team at Kickstarter. Feeling super fortunate to be able to do what I like, at a public benefit corp, on a platform with such a strong impact on the arts.

Love to my ustwo family. This lil’ reel still holds up:
