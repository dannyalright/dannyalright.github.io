Found this nugget whilst cleaning up my files. It's from Tamara Shopsin's [Arbitrary Stupid Goal](https://www.mcdbooks.com/books/arbitrary-stupid-goal){:target="_blank"}.

<figcaption>One missing piece of information from this scan: the Wolfawitzes are travelling across America. Their route and stops are determined by places they can find that start with 'W'.</figcaption>

I won't go into the philosophy as the above scan does that job. It's just nice to have a bit of validation in conjuring up a thread (to anything) that doesn't necessarily hold up.

Or maybe I will...

The thread—the arbitrary stupid goal—is just a tool to help you focus on the present. The mind's tendency to focus on the big picture can paralyse you into inaction and distraction from the present.
