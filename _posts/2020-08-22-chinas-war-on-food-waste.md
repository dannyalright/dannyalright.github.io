Read [this](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/21/world/asia/china-food-waste-xi.html) today on The New York Times:

> A school said it would bar students from applying for scholarships if their daily leftovers exceeded a set amount.

I wish this were done in the name of reducing carbon footprint. I have a feeling though that it's more about self-sufficiency in a more tenuous world.

> Mr. Xiâ€™s call is as much a warning against the dangers of profligacy as it is a reflection of the generational shift in values that has emerged as living standards rise.

Also, new word: 'profligacy'.
