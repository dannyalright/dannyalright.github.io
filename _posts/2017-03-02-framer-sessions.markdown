It’s been just over a year and a half since starting Framer Sessions NYC. ustwo. Given the pace at which Framer has iterated, it feels like a good time to reflect on running these.

## How it started
Having Framer in my back pocket was a huge asset whilst doing freelance product design from late 2014 to mid-2015. Constant high-fidelity prototypes—and more importantly, prototyping as a mindset/iterative design tool to be generative with a client, throughout an engagement—was unusual from what I knew.

Joining ustwo in August that year gave me a broader environment to keep advocating for this practice, as well as an insanely beautiful events space. Being relatively new to the city, I thought it would be the perfect opportunity to create an community around such an amazing tool.

I met Koen and Jorn, in person shortly after joining ustwo, and had the first Framer Session set for November 5th, 2015. Here’s a photo of us at around that time:

And here it is in action:

Two resources that helped start me off were [Setting up a technical meet-up, a framer case-study](https://blog.framer.com/how-to-host-to-a-framer-session-9e887ce6d7d1) and the structure from Framer Seattle meetups [from around that time](https://www.facebook.com/events/1704332906452240/).


## Lessons learnt

Some anecdotal notes that I learnt along the way.


1. Figure out how to accommodate different skill levels
  1. Otherwise you’ll end up with a gulf: beginners and intermediates all falling back to extreme basics (with an expectation that they’ll learn everything in this meetup), and advanced and intermediates doing something extremely complex, that is likely to scare off many of the people there
2. You need helpers/moderators/facilitators
  1. Running a meetup is about 3-4x amount of the work that I anticipated.
3. It’s really hard without people being naturally engaged
  1. You need to have a clear agenda to avoid it becoming an introductory course, every time
    1. Framer is also NOT the thing you can learn in one session and leave
      1. Although you can successfully overcome the “this is too hard for me”
        1. Which I’ve seen in almost every meetup
  2. I’ve run sessions with a turn out of over 30 people, with not one person willing to talk to the group about a project, or interject from my spiel
    1. I put that down to my own lack of fostering a collaborative environment
4. Realize that this is New York. People flake
5. Similarly, if it rains that day, cut your food & drinks order by half
6. Food and drinks are EXPENSIVE
  1. Get a sponsor, or your workplace to help out. It’s great for them too, if they know how to make the most of it
    1. ClassPass had a recruiter float in sessions—not at all interruptive, instead making the most of having so many talented people in one room
  2. Pizza is cheap, convenient, and easily sharable. If possible, try and think of something more inclusive blah blah…
7. Have plenty of signage, everywhere
8. Get people to talk, somehow
9. Before the meetup: spread far and wide. Get out of just the tech and design circles. This is something I’m horrible at.

## Our current approach

You might see from the lessons-learnt that many of them are around format and delivery. Below is currently how we run meet-ups. It is far from perfect, but the most successful from what I’ve experienced is:


1. **Mingling** for 10–15 min
  1. Allow people to get to know each other. This happens organically sometimes, and not at all at other times
  2. Food & drink
2. **Intros** for 5 min
  1. Food, drinks, helpers
  2. Heads up that a show and tell is happening: prepare your prototypes
3. **Show and tell** for 20 min
  1. Demo something that you, yourself, have done with new Framer features (which there almost always are)
  2. Encourage others to come up and show
    1. This is by far the hardest part
    2. Prizes don’t help IMO
  3. Have any special guests in town? Try and get them to demo
    1. *After* people do their individual demos: otherwise they will be intimated

1. **Skill-level breakouts** for the rest of whatever time you have
  1. Beginners:
    101 tutorial and then step-by-step building of something real
    1. Aim: If you can get them to leave feeling confident that Framer *is approachable*, that’s huge. Bonus points if they leave understanding the foundation of Framer and some basic approaches
  2. Intermediate & advanced:
    break-out into collaborative groups for discussion and problem-solving of individual prototypes
    1. This is hard, because there is always a spectrum of skills. It is often overrun by niche and intimitating demos or discussions that arguably aren’t a good fit for Framer (a design tool). Ideally you will have moderators to spot divergent skill levels and conversations, and physically separate and therefore foster all of them.

After the meet up: share notes, links, etc.


The most successful (collaborative, diverse, consistent turn-outs), longest-running Framer meetup I’ve seen is [Framer Seattle](http://facebook.com/groups/framerjs.seattle/), run by [Stephen Crowley](https://twitter.com/stephenncrowley) and [Jordan Dobson](https://twitter.com/jordandobson). I’ve never been physically (one day), but I’d encourage anyone in the area to give it a go. As well as any Framer meetup [in the world](http://framer.com/community/meetups/).


**Diversity and inclusion**
The photos shared from various Framer events show a pretty male-heavy crowd. That’s a somewhat accurate reflection in my mind. It was probably about 70/30 male/female. That ratio has started to even out in the last few meetups, from what I can tell.

I’d appreciate any actionable feedback on how to make these meetups more neutral.


## Going forward

I started Framer NYC solo, with some generous logistics and event setup with the likes of ustwobies such as [Simon Lindsay](http://twitter.com/simonlindsay) and new friends such as X Dobson. Since then, [Noah Levin](http://twitter.com/nlevin) & [Jared Palmer](http://twitter.com/jaredpalmer) have joined to help run these things going forward. We’ve begun to host them outside of ustwo, on (hopefully) a rotating venue.

I’ve also spread my focus to other prototyping tools such as [Origami](http://origami.design), where you may or may not hear my voice on [the tutorial videos](http://origami.design/tutorials/getting-started/Getting-Started.html). I wrote about some of those experiences here [my blog post on Origami].

I’ve always seen Framer as a general design tool, rather than a prototyping tool. It’s exciting to see it move more in that direction and people take it on as such.
