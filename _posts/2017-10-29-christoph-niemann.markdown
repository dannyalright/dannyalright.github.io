Almost missed this. Pretty relieved we didn't [^dates].

Something I notice more and more about [Christoph Niemann](https://www.instagram.com/abstractsunday/) is his presentation and delivery—no matter which medium the work is in. I can guess with fairly high confidence that he is a storyboarding-fiend; mapping out his exhibition/book/feature article/app over a series of frames, over and over again.

The work itself is rare: both high-quality craftsmanship and highly-impactful topical messaging. At least in what I usually come across, the weighting is usually only on one side of that scale.

More on the SVA Masters Series [here](http://www.sva.edu/page/the-masters-series). [This talk](http://99u.com/videos/51180/christoph-niemann-how-to-overcome-the-3-fears-every-creative-faces) recorded by 99u is pretty similar to one I've seen him give recently.
