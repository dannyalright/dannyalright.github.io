Have you heard of the Homunculus Man? Sometimes he goes by Cortical Homunculus, or "cortex man".

I hadn't heard of him either, until this morning. Here's what he looks like:

Lou, my physiotherapist, mentioned him when describing how pain can be over or under represented depending on which part of the body it comes from. We pay more attention (via our cortex) to some parts of our body than others.

Homunculus Man is a three dimensional representation of our bias. A personified visualisation better than anything I've seen in a Tufte book.

He even adapts to lived experiences. So my version of Homunculus Man would have an oversized right ankle from all the times I've rolled it.
