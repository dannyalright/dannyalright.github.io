These three design studio exercises are intended to elicit tangible attributes for designing product, and most importantly, have everyone's 2c heard and considered.

## Requirements
1. An existing or in-process brand, product.
2. A (roughly) shared view of aforementioned brand amongst the group of participants.

## Method
### 1. Metamorphosis
Spend 2 minutes writing ‘if this brand were X, it would be Y’ for the following:

- Furniture
- Animal
- Brand
- Food & Drink
- Kids toy
- Location
- Personality
- Transport
- Texture

The results should look a little like this:

### 2. Organising attributes
Take a high-level view of the results of the above. Take post-it notes and cluster into high-level themes. Name each theme.

For example: post-it notes take from different categories such as ‘warm’, ‘dependable’, ‘wise’, and ‘role-model’ might be themed as ‘Guiding Light’.

### 3. Creating brand attributes
For each theme, list attributes for the following areas:
Symbol
Typography
Photography
Illustration
Color
Motion
Graphic forms
Sound
Language

The attributes can be recycled from the Metamorphosis exercises, or made anew.

# Next steps
What you do after the above exercises varies for the desired output. For most visually-orientated outputs (brand identity, visual design) the next steps might be beginning moodboards informed by the brand attributes.
