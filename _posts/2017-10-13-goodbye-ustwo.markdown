Last Friday was my last day at ustwo. After a few years there, and a range of agency experiences elsewhere, I’ve decided to take a step away from client services.

ustwo was (and still is) a special place. It’s been gut-wrenching to leave. Some personal highlights:

- The [fampany](http://medium.com/offscreen-revisited/the-only-deep-true-interview-with-matt-mills-miller-co-founder-of-ustwo-7afe581b9931). As much flack as we give the thing, it did feel like a big ol' family
- Ana's empanadas
- Broken clocks, glass walls, and hoverboards
- Pecha Kuchas

The structure of ustwo (fampany etc) and support of peers meant I had serious autonomy. Using LittleBits in the design process, augmenting a games team, and hosting Framer Sessions were all easy to do and encouraged. The flat nature of ustwo also forced some skills to develop I wouldn’t have elsewhere.

Later this month I’ll be going in-house: joining the mobile team at Kickstarter. Feeling super fortunate to be able to do what I like, at a [public benefit corp](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/21/technology/kickstarters-altruistic-vision-profits-as-the-means-not-the-mission.html), on a platform with such a strong impact on the arts.

Much love to my ustwo family. This reel still holds up:
