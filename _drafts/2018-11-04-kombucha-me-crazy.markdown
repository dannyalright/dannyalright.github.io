This is your no-bullshit guide to making kombucha. From recent-noob to noob. Because there are two many damn thousand word preludes for online guides and recipes these days.

## What exactly we're making
64 oz of kombucha ready to drink, with everything in place to keep making more.

## How we're doing it
Allow about three weeks before you're drinking your own kombucha. The rest of this lost will cover the process of:

1. Getting the gear
2. Growing the SCOBY
3. First fermentation
4. Optional second round of fermentation

Diving in:

### Getting the gear
- 1 unpasteurised kombucha bottle
- 64 oz vessel or larger
- 32 oz vessel or larger
- 1 cheesecloth or rag
- 8 green or black teabags

Go out and buy yourself a bottle of unpasteurised kombucha. I bought GT at my local supermarket. You'll know it's _not_ unpasteurised if ....

If you don't have a 64 oz or bigger jug or vessel, pick one of those up too. Also grab a 32 oz or bigger jug, as you'll need something to grow your SCOBY in. More info on what that is soon.

### Growing the SCOBY
Pour the full bottle of unpasteurised kombucha into your 32 oz jar. Cover it with your cheesecloth or rag and a rubber band. This is to stop fruit flys from getting in.

Put the jar in a cupboard for two weeks. Give or take a few day or week depending on the climate where you live.

### First fermentation
Does your SCOBY look like this? Then you're ready to make your first batch of kombucha.

Put 64 oz of water to boil in a pot on the stove. Once boiled, take off heat and steep all eight teabags. Let them steep for 20 minutes.

Add 1 cup of sugar and stir. Your tea should be warm but not hot now. Pour all of the tea into your large jug.

Get your other jar—the one with your SCOBY—and pour it into the newly filled with tea jar. You might need to use your hands to move the SCOBY over.

Wait one week for weak kombucha. Wait about two for regular kombucha. Wait more for more tart.

### Optional second round of fermentation
Use this round to add any extra flavourings.
