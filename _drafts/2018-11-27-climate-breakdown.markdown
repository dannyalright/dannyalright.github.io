I’ve been thinking about this for a long time. I’ve been anxious about climate change for a long time, too.

Today we launched the [Environmental Resource Center](http://kickstarter.com/environment). It felt better than any other ‘release’ or launch I’ve done before. I’m also listening to a great podcast episode about permaculture; [Connor Jones on Tangentially Speaking](https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/tangentially-speaking-with-christopher-ryan/id566908883?mt=2&i=1000424336875).

Those two things combined made me realise that the best way to relieve stress about climate breakdown is to find an intersection of your skills and what’s needed, and then (most importantly) act. This is all very obvious, but finding that realistic intersection, or door knocking, or protesting[^list] is the toughest thing. Retweeting environmentally-charged tweets is easer.

The best thing of all about making things that help tackle climate change is this: because the lows are so low, the the high is so high. It feels amazing to put this out in the world.

We’ll see how long this line of thinking holds up for. Especially when my life, my own physical environment, is personally causing grief. FOr now though I’m going to continue making. 

[^list]: Here’s an ordered list of the most impactful things you can do to combat climate breakdown.
