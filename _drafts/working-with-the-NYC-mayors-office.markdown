We've just finished a 4 week engagement with the NYC Mayor's Office. Although short, it's been one of the more rewarding projects I've worked on.

### Chicken-and-egg
The City offers a tonne of benefits and programs, yet the people who need it most (low income, etc) are least aware of them.

### One 'hot app' to solve everything
I think we're nearing the end of mobile apps as being a sellable tool on its own. We fell victim to it in this projectâ€”our original brief was a cross-platform native app.

After doing the user testing sessions, it became pretty clear that an SMS or even email service integrated into shelters and library programs is a much more successful route.

## Update
Looks like what we prototyped in those 4 weeks has been launched as [Growing Up NYC](https://growingupnyc.cityofnewyork.us).

I'm a little disappointed that:

1. we didn't get to continue working on this, and
2. it's very similar to where we got to after 4 weeks.

There was a whole lot more left to validate and improve upon. Nonetheless, it's always nice to see something you contribute to go live in the world.
