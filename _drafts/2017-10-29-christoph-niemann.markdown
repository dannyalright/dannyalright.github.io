Almost missed this. Pretty relieved we didn't [^dates].

Something I notice more and more about [Christoph Niemann]() is his presentation and deliveryâ€”no matter which medium the work is in. I can guess with fairly high confidence that he is a storyboarding-fiend; mapping out his exhibition/book/feature article/app over a series of frames, over and over again.

The work itself is rare: both high-quality craftsmanship and highly-impactful topical messaging. At least in what I usually come across, the weighting is usually only on one side of that scale.
