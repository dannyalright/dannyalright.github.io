We're in the middle of a revolution in design tooling right now. They're making [Kickstarter]() [projects](), [Forbes]()... Yet at times, design tools feels like _all_ we're talking about within the design community. Oddly, the even-more-rapid context in which what we make is used is rarely discussed or misunderstood. It's odd because it's ultimately what we're serving. I have some thoughts on how we can do that better/flip this around.

This is something I've been mulling over for the past year or two. [Loupe 2018]() forced me to take this out of my brain and make it comprehendible. So here it is.

> A comparison of our, digital design, situation with that of urban design in the 1900s. Diving deep on some of the flawed assumptions of High Modernism and how it’s the easy path for us if we’re not careful.

> Focusing on the context of our tools rather than the tools themselves; how the things we make are used, in what situations, and how to be an optimist about it all.

I grew into digital design through Photoshop. I want to do a little morning exercise—show of hands—who else had the same experience? Ok. At the same time, maybe a little bit beforehand, I was doing a little bit of Paint—anyone have the same experience? Maybe a little bit of Paint 98?

Ok, for this one, don't be shy. For who here was Sketch the first design tool that they got into design software with? Alright. A couple of hands.

Any other big ones that I'm missing? Flash, Fireworks, Director. Who's still using any of these tools, because I definitely am. Yeah, every day for me as well—I'm using at least one of these.

Like Asha said, my name is Danny I work at Kickstarter but I've been involved in the tools space in the last couple of years and been lucky enough to work on some of them directly.

I always think back though, that it's pretty fascinating that these tools—at leats a lot of the ones we've just talked about—are either print design tools, or in the case of Sketch, Flash, Fireworks, Director—these things evolved either directly or indirectly from print design tools—which is kind of amazing when you think about it because all the way back Gutenburg 7th century, China before that, movable type, the printing press, all these tools that we're using even through to desktop publishing—they're coming from a world where designers set the type, mixed the colours, handled the paper stock.

We kept on using these print tools all the way through digital except when those of us who went to make digital things we starting to make _models_; high fidelity models of the actual thing—instead of (how we did it) in the old days when we actually did everything from start to finish.

I think we always knew this, and then tools like the original Framer didn't really help; it made us realise that this is indeed backwards.

And then there was that question of ~2016: "Should designers code?".

I think this was a bad question, because it equates code as just another one of these tools to make models and that's the extent of it. But actually, there's something really interesting about the question—and maybe this is something that the design community got maybe before I did, but once I stewed on it for a little while, and reflected on it now especially with Framer X; at it's core, the question is about "code". It's not really "Should designers code?", it's "How do we (designers) work with code?". Do we interact with the tools, with code directly? Do we do that through an interface like Framer? Or if you're a sound designer, something else? I think _that_ is actually the power of where we are right now, because it doesn't matter what we use—**we're recognising as a community that we're pushing and pulling to and from the same source as our engineers**.

We're more like the games industry where they have

- level designers
- lighting specialists
- software engineers
- product managers
- etc

all of us can work in the same fashion now and build upon each-others work.

It's kind of hard to visually represent this, so I did the best analogy I could think of.

## Fab Five

Has anyone seen this show before? So, if you're unfamiliar with it, it is Queer Eye. These five guys are the Fab Five; Bobby on design, Kuaramo on lifestyle and culture, Anthony on food, Jonathan on grooming and Tan on fashion.

They do something similar, except code isn't their medium—it's a human being. And they're pushing and pulling this human. They all have their individual expertise, their own tools, and their own disciplines. Yet instead of doing one at a time and then handing off, Antony will come and see Jonathan give the guy a haircut and wow "now it's my turn to up the game with cooking". You know—there's this kind of back-and-forth always and if you've seen an episode; it's not actually about the haircut or the house that's the most interesting part. It's actually the output of each episode; that person's life has been completely transformed.

And it's that surrounding context that I want to talk about. Because whilst all of this has been going on in design in terms of workflow and our tooling being disrupted; actually the things that we've made/make from the tools has been completely changed. Software is definitely eating the world.

Think about the way that you last:

- rented a movie
- said happy birthday
- how you went on that last date
- etc

All of these things we're disrupting through what we do.

It can be kind of overwhelming especially for me in the couple of years I've been reflecting on this a lot. But luckily we're not the first design discipline to go through this.

## We're not the first

Anyone know where this is?

<!-- http://artchist.wordpress.com/2016/02/17/bijlmer-neighbourhood-in-amsterdam/#jp-carousel-871 -->

It's the Bijlmermeer; an example from a time when the design of built environment actually had a really similar trifecta as what we do in design in product design. Tooling being reinforced concrete but more importantly, their audience was general urbanisation in the word. Especially in Europe post-war cities that needed restructuring, and architecture as a practice went through a remit change.

Like _our_ new seat at the table; architects because formally responsible for the health and safety of the people who interacted with and inhabited the buildings that they designed.

So the Bijlmer is an example of a specific _approach_ to urban design. I think it's actually one we could go down _if_—not something I think we're doing right now, but if we were to focus only on our toolkits and not actually think about the surrounding context. Because this approach is one that is an **unrelenting belief on technological progress being the thing that advances or 'solves' the human condition**. It sounds kind of weird, and the poster boy of this movement Le Corbusier _was_ kind of weird.

If you've ever seen any of his work; he wrote a book called _Radiant City_ amongst others. He had a vision for what High Modernitiy was whilst overlooking Paris in an aeroplane, and I think that speaks volumes about High Moderinty as a philosophy which is: if things can be standardised and made perfect from a technological point of view, then they should be duplicated down to the screw size across the world—wherever it will be implemented.

So. He wrote the book _Radiant City_. He was also one of those designers that does a bit of everything, has his hand in every kind of discipline. So he's left us a lot of artefacts.

This is his rendition of a future Beunos Aires.

Funny angle, yeah? All the way back form the sea.

This one he did after after coming down from an aeroplane in Rio De Janerio. If you've been there, you know it's pretty geographically gnarly. So this kind of expressway or aqueduct type thing is pretty amazing.

{% include image.html name="rio.jpg" caption="Rio De Janeiro as rendered by Le Corbusier." %}

And this one breaks my heart. If you've been to Paris, maybe it does to yours too. This is his blueprint for the Radiant City, but specifically applied to Paris.

{% include image.html name="radiant-city-plans.jpg" caption="The Radiant City." %}

You can see in the distance you have these high-rise buildings, that are the designer perfect places to work. In the mid-to-foreground you have these medium-rise buildings that are the perfect places to live, and then kind of in the middle here we have these massive vistas of parks for people to play. And then super highways to get between all three of these because there's no concept of a sidewalk or a footpath or house-facing street.

He also left us this:

  caption="First: A handy block-size comparison chart. Second: via zijnwijdat.nl."
  media="
  block-sizes.jpg
  bijlmermeer-site-plan-1980s.jpg" %}

...which goes into detail with the different sizes of his 'super' blocks compared to blocks that existed back then and still do (thankfully) today. So Paris, New York, Buenos Aires.

So the Bijlmer wasn't built by Le Corbusier but it was definitely done in his footsteps, and int he footsteps of high modernity.

I think the intentions of the designers of the Bijlmer and Le Corbusier were actually quite good; it was about improving the human condition. In hindsight it's easy to realise it was a little naive because this kind of 'designing from above' is actually the antithesis of what people need in design because we are complex beings—we're not as simple as having something very regimented given to us.

There's funny examples; there's the story about the Bijlmermeer, and in Brasilia (an entire city built in this same way, too) where people couldn't find their apartment they couldn't set a meeting place with someone just because the way these things were built.

But there's actually more severe examples of how this architecture and how this type of design and workflow has failed people.

{% include media-grid.html

This was Pruitt-Igoe in St, Louis, MI. It was a housing development. Built from a blank slate as you can see its cleared-away land in the centre. The surrounding buildings are tenement buildings. To understand why Pruitt-Igoe was a failure, you need to think about the things it replaced (other tenement buildings).

Designers had a blank slate. They had this land cleared and put in these kind of Le Corbusier Radiant City-style super-blocks which were the 'perfect' places to live. With enough green space, ventilation, air, all the things that were technologically deemed to be important at the time.

But the tenement buildings that they replaced—

I live in New York by the way, so I like to use New York examples. This is Hester Street, I think it still looks a bit like this on the Lower East Side:

{% include media-grid.html
  type="even"
  caption="First: Berenice Abbott, 1936. Second: Vergara, Camilo J, 1970."
  media="
  hester-street.jpg
  vergara-camilo.jpg" %}

...these are the types of buildings that Pruitt-Igoe replaced. You see these mixed-use type buildings with people hanging out the front. There are shops, there are houses up those stoops, people are selling things on the street.

This one is maybe a little closer to Alphabet City. These kids are mucking around with a fire hydrant. They're not at school, they're not at home, but they're also not in a defined 'playground' / 'play area'. This kind of living, this kind of sidewalk-facing street is complex and seemingly chaotic **because it is, and because _we_ are too**.

But it's also quite hard for designers to map and to systemise these sort of things. Combine that with some socio-economic problems like in St Louis in that particular part and you have yourself a situation where this kind of design or urban environment is to blame for peoples' problems and then gets wiped-out and gets replaced by a type of design that actually got demolished on TV.

  pruitt-igoe-collapse-series-3.jpg
  pruitt-igoe-collapse-series-4.jpg" %}

I don't think there's a Pruitt Igoe, Bijlmermeer, or Brasilia of product design yet—but I do worry that the \*\*failures of these designers are ones we could make too if we're not too careful with thinking about our surrounding context. In our world we _have_ to simplify and systemise just to be able to work with our design tools and our computers, and then to design something that goes into someone's hand they can peck away at.

## We're in a good position, though

But I'm optimist about this because I think we're actually in a really good position to handle this and with our new workflows.

## JJ

This is one my of my personal heroes; her name is Jane Jacobs, and she was a professional writer—but also an activist and expert in what makes good urban environments.

{% include media-grid.html

One of my favourite passages from her is:

> The best way to plan for downtown is to see how people use it today.

### Designing with data

There are obviously different degrees to this, but it turns out that even the easy one has a lot of wins for us. And being a design (tools) conference, I'm sure a lot of you already do this with injecting data, or data into avatars and strings, but there's actually a whole lot of different degrees we can do this _within_ an easy degree. Because if we inform our interfaces inherently from whatever our downtowns are, it produces something that actually reflects the people we're making it for.

This also can extend itself to using the same hard hardware, the same software, the same network speeds even as the people you're designing for—because it's probably different from what you use.

### Leave the office

But of course to be more true to Jane Jacobs; those of who can, should be able to leave the office and take our increasingly mobile/remote setup and physically embed ourselves in the communities that we're designing for.

It can be hard to justify sitting on a park bench to your colleagues or your bosses or maybe, but that kind of ethnographic research is invaluable. And like designing with data, this inform what we're doing from the very beginning and not be something that we stress test or do at the very end.

I have another New York example. This is Times Square; still kind of looks like this from some angles.

{% include image.html name="times-square.jpg" caption="From left: Hiroko Masuike, Damon Winter, Justin Maxon, 2009, for The New York Times." %}

This is from one day in 2009. The then-transport commissioner and her team they as an experiment shut down 5 blocks to cars. They went to the local hardware store, picked up some paint and lawn chairs, and set them out. People turned out, started to hang out, and then they had to go and buy some more lawn chairs.

This temporary plaza was so successful it was eventually made permanent.

I'm showing you this because this an artefact of the design of built environment learning from its past and making changes. This design process was informed by city data, prototyped on the cheap with cheap materials, and involved a mix of people to get right.

## Embrace difference

That brings me to my last point, and admittedly this is one I didn't consciously seek out—it was one I happened to discover through experience. And it sounds obvious but only by having different people on our teams do we really have the diversity of thought that we need to make things that really resonate with our different audiences.

I think our new tooling allows for this more than ever now, as well. And especially in this room; as a Framer conference; as the makers as the advocates, and as the users and stewards of these tools we're actually maybe responsible for making sure our tools are as open to our non-traditional designer teammates, but also our non-designer teammates too.

I've given a lot of flack to High Modernitiy but it was a legitimate response to what was happening in the world, 50–60 years. What we're making now is impacting the world severely. Good and bad. It's used by people to decide who to vote for or how or why to take action on a complex issue like climate change. People use what we make to meet their life partners. And as their primary form of communication.

This is a lot, but ultimately I'm an optimist about this. Because our digital medium has something that the design of built environment _doesn't_ have, and it's why places likes the Bijlmer or Brasilia are still around in their flawed form. It takes generations to suffer through, and then eventually modify or replace bad urban design. But in our world, we can make strides; we can go t our streets and design from below, and put it in peoples' hands next week. And then we can do the same thing the week after.

So I'm actually excited about where we are right now and I hope you are too.
