We're in the middle of a revolution in design tooling right now. Yet at times, design tools feels like _all_ we're talking about within the design community. Oddly, the even-more-rapid context in which what we make is used is rarely discussed or misunderstood. It's odd because it's ultimately what we're serving. I have some thoughts on how we can do that better/flip this around.

This is something I've been mulling over for the past year or two. Loupe 2018 forced me to take this out of my brain and make it comprehendible. So here it is...

I've written a condensed version for your reading pleasure and (mostly) for my own archiving. Enjoy.

## Reality check

I grew into digital design through Photoshop, and Paint before that. Today, I rely on newer, built-for-digital-design tools like Sketch and Figma. I'd argue that all of these—including Sketch—are inherintely (and accidentally) print design tools.

Gutenburg 7th century, China before that, movable type, the printing press... All of these tools that we're (still) using even through desktop publishing come from a world where designers set the type, mixed the colours, handled the paper stock.

We kept on using these same print tools through to digital interface design—except to make _models_; high fidelity models of the actual thing.

I think we always knew this, and then tools like the original Framer exposed this workflow is indeed backwards. Made most palpable by the great question of 2016:

> Should designers code?

I think this was a bad question as it equated code as another model-making tool. The _intent_ of the question is much more interesting:

> How do we (designers) work with code?

We're recognising as a community that we're pushing and pulling to and from the same source as our engineers. It's not about which tool we interface with to wrangle code—or whether we do so directly—the output is shared and therefore the same.

We're certainly not the first to have this realisation. The games industry for example has historically worked in this way. You might have:

- level designers
- programmers
- animators
- environment artists
- SFX specialists
- lighting specialists

...all building upon each-others work.

It's kind of hard to visually represent this, so I've come up with the best analogy I could...

### The Fab Five model

Queer Eye is a great lesson on humanity. It's also a great lesson on collaboration.

{% include media-grid.html
  type="single-right"
  caption="Bobby, Karamo, Antony, Jonathan, Tan."
  media="
  fab-five.jpg" %}

These guys do something similar to the games industry—except the medium is a human being. Each member has their own individual expertise and tools, yet work concurrently on the same subject. Antony will be prepping a meal plan whilst Jonathan is doing the man's grooming, and whilst Bobby is at the hardware store. They'll check in and out, both with the central subject and eachother.

### Surrounding context

If you've seen an episode you know the haircut and the house are not the lasting takeaways. It's almost always the _softer_ output; the life transformation brought about by virtue of the Fab Five's technical skillsets.

And it's this same softer output we need to be conizant of in our world, too. Our workflow and tooling are being disrupted like never before—as are the social and cultural conduits they help build.

Think about the way that you last:

- rented a movie
- said happy birthday to a friend
- found and organised that last date
- had food show up to your house
- found your current place of work

We were asking a technical question with _"should designers code?"_ and ended up with an overwhelming answer. Luckily, we're not the first design discipline to go through this kind of transformation...

## Pouring slabs

Not too far from central Amsterdam is an incredible piece of living history; the Bijlmermeer.

{% include media-grid.html

<!-- http://artchist.wordpress.com/2016/02/17/bijlmer-neighbourhood-in-amsterdam/#jp-carousel-871 -->

The Bijlmermeer is a living, visitable example from a time when the design of built environment actually had a really similar trifecta as what we do in design in product design. Tooling being reinforced concrete but more importantly, their audience was general urbanisation in the word. Especially in Europe post-war cities that needed restructuring, and architecture as a practice went through a remit change.

Like _our_ new seat at the table; architects because formally responsible for the health and safety of the people who interacted with and inhabited the buildings that they designed.

So the Bijlmer is an example of a specific _approach_ to urban design. I think it's actually one we could go down _if_—not something I think we're doing right now, but if we were to focus only on our toolkits and not actually think about the surrounding context. Because this approach is one that is an **unrelenting belief on technological progress being the thing that advances or 'solves' the human condition**. It sounds kind of weird, and the poster boy of this movement Le Corbusier _was_ kind of weird.

{% include media-grid.html
  type="single-right"
  caption="Wim Dussel, 1955."
  media="
  le-corbusier.jpg" %}

If you've ever seen any of his work; he wrote a book called _Radiant City_ amongst others. He had a vision for what High Modernitiy was whilst overlooking Paris in an aeroplane, and I think that speaks volumes about High Moderinty as a philosophy which is: if things can be standardised and made perfect from a technological point of view, then they should be duplicated down to the screw size across the world—wherever it will be implemented.

So. He wrote the book _Radiant City_. He was also one of those designers that does a bit of everything, has his hand in every kind of discipline. So he's left us a lot of artefacts.

This is his rendition of a future Beunos Aires.

{% include media-grid.html
  type="single-left"
  caption="Buenos Aires as rendered by Le Corbusier."
  media="
  buenos-aires.jpg" %}

Funny angle, yeah? All the way back form the sea.

This one he did after after coming down from an aeroplane in Rio De Janerio. If you've been there, you know it's pretty geographically gnarly. So this kind of expressway or aqueduct type thing is pretty amazing.

{% include image.html name="rio.jpg" caption="Rio De Janeiro as rendered by Le Corbusier." %}

And this one breaks my heart. If you've been to Paris, maybe it does to yours too. This is his blueprint for the Radiant City, but specifically applied to Paris.

{% include image.html name="radiant-city-plans.jpg" caption="The Radiant City." %}

You can see in the distance you have these high-rise buildings, that are the designer perfect places to work. In the mid-to-foreground you have these medium-rise buildings that are the perfect places to live, and then kind of in the middle here we have these massive vistas of parks for people to play. And then super highways to get between all three of these because there's no concept of a sidewalk or a footpath or house-facing street.

He also left us this:

{% include media-grid.html
  type="even"
  caption="First: A handy block-size comparison chart. Second: via zijnwijdat.nl."
  media="
  block-sizes.jpg
  bijlmermeer-site-plan-1980s.jpg" %}

...which goes into detail with the different sizes of his 'super' blocks compared to blocks that existed back then and still do (thankfully) today. So Paris, New York, Buenos Aires.

So the Bijlmer wasn't built by Le Corbusier but it was definitely done in his footsteps, and int he footsteps of high modernity.

### Designing from above

I think the intentions of the designers of the Bijlmer and Le Corbusier were actually quite good; it was about improving the human condition. In hindsight it's easy to realise it was a little naive because this kind of 'designing from above' is actually the antithesis of what people need in design because we are complex beings—we're not as simple as having something very regimented given to us.

There's funny examples; there's the story about the Bijlmermeer, and in Brasilia (an entire city built in this same way, too) where people couldn't find their apartment they couldn't set a meeting place with someone just because the way these things were built.

But there's actually more severe examples of how this architecture and how this type of design and workflow has failed people.

{% include media-grid.html
  type="single-right"
  caption="United States Geological Survey, 1963–72."
  media="
  pruitt-igoe-USGS02.jpg" %}

This was Pruitt-Igoe in St, Louis, MI. It was a housing development. Built from a blank slate as you can see its cleared-away land in the centre. The surrounding buildings are tenement buildings. To understand why Pruitt-Igoe was a failure, you need to think about the things it replaced (other tenement buildings).

Designers had a blank slate. They had this land cleared and put in these kind of Le Corbusier Radiant City-style super-blocks which were the 'perfect' places to live. With enough green space, ventilation, air, all the things that were technologically deemed to be important at the time.

But the tenement buildings that they replaced—

I live in New York by the way, so I like to use New York examples. This is Hester Street, I think it still looks a bit like this on the Lower East Side:

{% include media-grid.html
  type="even"
  caption="First: Berenice Abbott, 1936. Second: Vergara, Camilo J, 1970."
  media="
  hester-street.jpg
  vergara-camilo.jpg" %}

...these are the types of buildings that Pruitt-Igoe replaced. You see these mixed-use type buildings with people hanging out the front. There are shops, there are houses up those stoops, people are selling things on the street.

This one is maybe a little closer to Alphabet City. These kids are mucking around with a fire hydrant. They're not at school, they're not at home, but they're also not in a defined 'playground' / 'play area'. This kind of living, this kind of sidewalk-facing street is complex and seemingly chaotic **because it is, and because _we_ are too**.

But it's also quite hard for designers to map and to systemise these sort of things. Combine that with some socio-economic problems like in St Louis in that particular part and you have yourself a situation where this kind of design or urban environment is to blame for peoples' problems and then gets wiped-out and gets replaced by a type of design that actually got demolished on TV.

  pruitt-igoe-collapse-series-2.jpg
  pruitt-igoe-collapse-series-3.jpg
  pruitt-igoe-collapse-series-4.jpg" %}

I don't think there's a Pruitt Igoe, Bijlmermeer, or Brasilia of product design yet—but I do worry that the \*\*failures of these designers are ones we could make too if we're not too careful with thinking about our surrounding context. In our world we _have_ to simplify and systemise just to be able to work with our design tools and our computers, and then to design something that goes into someone's hand they can peck away at.

## Designing from below

But I'm optimist about this because I think we're actually in a really good position to handle this and with our new workflows.

This is one my of my personal heroes; her name is Jane Jacobs, and she was a professional writer—but also an activist and expert in what makes good urban environments.

{% include media-grid.html
  type="single-left"
  caption="Phil Stanziola, 1961."
  media="
  jane-jacobs.jpg" %}

One of my favourite passages from her is:

> The best way to plan for downtown is to see how people use it today.

### Designing with data

There are obviously different degrees to this, but it turns out that even the easy one has a lot of wins for us. And being a design (tools) conference, I'm sure a lot of you already do this with injecting data, or data into avatars and strings, but there's actually a whole lot of different degrees we can do this _within_ an easy degree. Because if we inform our interfaces inherently from whatever our downtowns are, it produces something that actually reflects the people we're making it for.

This also can extend itself to using the same hard hardware, the same software, the same network speeds even as the people you're designing for—because it's probably different from what you use.

### Leaving the office

But of course to be more true to Jane Jacobs; those of who can, should be able to leave the office and take our increasingly mobile/remote setup and physically embed ourselves in the communities that we're designing for.

It can be hard to justify sitting on a park bench to your colleagues or your bosses or maybe, but that kind of ethnographic research is invaluable. And like designing with data, this inform what we're doing from the very beginning and not be something that we stress test or do at the very end.

I have another New York example. This is Times Square; still kind of looks like this from some angles.

{% include image.html name="times-square.jpg" caption="From left: Hiroko Masuike, Damon Winter, Justin Maxon, 2009, for The New York Times." %}

This is from one day in 2009. The then-transport commissioner and her team they as an experiment shut down 5 blocks to cars. They went to the local hardware store, picked up some paint and lawn chairs, and set them out. People turned out, started to hang out, and then they had to go and buy some more lawn chairs.

This temporary plaza was so successful it was eventually made permanent.

### Embracing difference

I'm showing you this because this an artefact of the design of built environment learning from its past and making changes. This design process was informed by city data, prototyped on the cheap with cheap materials, and involved a mix of people to get right.

Only by having different people on our teams do we really have the diversity of thought that we need to make things that really resonate with our different audiences. And so as the makers, advocates, users, and stewards of tools we are responsible for ensuring they are open to our non-traditional designer and non-designer teammates.

## Git push

High Modernity, for all its faults, was a legitimate response to what was happening in the world at its ascendency, 50–60 years ago. What we're making now is impacting the world severely. Good and bad. It's used by people to decide who to vote for or how or why to take action on a complex issue like climate change. People use what we make to meet their life partners. And as their primary form of communication.

This is a lot, but ultimately I'm an optimist about this. Because our digital medium has something that the design of built environment _doesn't_ have, and it's why places likes the Bijlmer or Brasilia are still around in their flawed form. It takes generations to suffer through, and then eventually modify or replace bad urban design. But in our world, we can make strides; we can go to our streets and design from below, and put it in peoples' hands next week. And then we can do the same thing the week after.
