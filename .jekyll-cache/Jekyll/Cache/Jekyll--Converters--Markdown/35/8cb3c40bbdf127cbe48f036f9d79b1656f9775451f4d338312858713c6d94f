I"Ó<p>It seems like everyone has a use for Terminal these days but the people most uncomfortable with it (think PMs, designers) have the heaviest lifting to do. Shortcuts are so wildly helpful for making Terminal approachableâ€”yet are somehow unexplained and impenetrable for those that need them.</p>

<p>Hereâ€™s my attempt to fix that.</p>

<h2 id="the-long-way">The long way</h2>

<p>Repeatedly typing in the same commands into Terminal is annoying, takes time, and is prone to mistakes. Letâ€™s look at some examples of my common commands to illustrate this.</p>

<p>To navigate to my personal siteâ€™s local folder, Iâ€™d manually type:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>cd ~/Projects/dannywhite.site
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>That would almost always be followed up by the command to start the local Jekyll server to preview changes to that site:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>bundle exec jekyll serve
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And then Iâ€™d want to open this folder up in Atom. I donâ€™t even know how to do this long-hand in Terminal so would probably just navigate to said folder via Finder and drag it onto Atomâ€™s app icon.</p>

<p>A bit painful.</p>

<h2 id="the-quick-way">The quick way</h2>

<p>You can shorten these commands into shortcuts of your choosing. My shortcuts for the above three commands are <code class="highlighter-rouge">me</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">jek</code>, and <code class="highlighter-rouge">atom</code> respectively. So to get those same three things done, Iâ€™d instead write:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>me
jek
atom .
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Letâ€™s give it a try. Open Terminal and type <code class="highlighter-rouge">nano .bash_profile</code>. This should create and open the <em>.bash_profile</em> file inside of Terminal.</p>

<p>Hereâ€™s what mine looks like with shortcuts already made at the bottom:</p>

<!-- Wrapping in div necessary to avoid Markdown rendering as <code> -->
<div class="media">
   
  <!-- Host images locally by default -->
  <img data-src="/assets/posts/2018-04-07-bash-your-profile/nano-bash_profile.png" />
   
</div>

<p>Notice the syntax that each of my shortcuts are using? Hereâ€™s a breakdown:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>alias your-shortcut-name="whatever-you're-shortening"
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">alias</code>: as the word suggests, this defines the following will be an â€˜aliasâ€™, or shortcut.</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">your-shortcut-name</code>: replace this with your desired shortcut word; what you will type in Terminal to actually do that longer, gnarlier thing. If your shortcut is to open Visual Studio Code, you might write replace this with <code class="highlighter-rouge">code</code>.</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">"whatever-you're-shortening"</code>: if your shortcut is to navigate to a directory, you would replace this with <code class="highlighter-rouge">"cd ~/My Folder/"</code>. If your shortcut is to open an application, you would replace this with <code class="highlighter-rouge">"open -a App Name"</code>.</p>

<p>Simply add any of your desired shortcuts to the bottom of this file, above <code class="highlighter-rouge">source ~/.bashrc</code>. Save <em>.bash_profile</em> and restart Terminal. Your shortcuts should now work.</p>

<h2 id="the-pro-zone">The pro zone</h2>

<p>I donâ€™t even need to fuss in Terminal now that I have an application shortcut for Atom. Instead of writing the command <code class="highlighter-rouge">nano .bash_profile</code>, I can use my fancy shortcut <code class="highlighter-rouge">atom .bash_profile</code> for a nicer experience. Just make sure to restart Terminal after saving your changes.</p>

<!-- Wrapping in div necessary to avoid Markdown rendering as <code> -->
<div class="media">
   
  <!-- Host images locally by default -->
  <img data-src="/assets/posts/2018-04-07-bash-your-profile/atom-bash_profile.png" />
   
</div>

<p>Keep an eye on an nearby engineer as they use Terminal. You might see them use shortcuts beyond applications and directories such as using <code class="highlighter-rouge">gc</code> for <code class="highlighter-rouge">git commit</code>. Itâ€™s all up to you. Colours, ASCII art, and things Iâ€™m yet to figure out are also customisable via <em>.bash_profile</em>.</p>

<p>Shout out to Stephanie Coleman who introduced me to all of this at Kickstarter. My .bash_profile lives in a <a href="https://gist.github.com/dannyalright/5856920a9579200f59bbcc8bfe76b05c">Gist</a> if youâ€™ve like to use it as a starting-point.</p>
