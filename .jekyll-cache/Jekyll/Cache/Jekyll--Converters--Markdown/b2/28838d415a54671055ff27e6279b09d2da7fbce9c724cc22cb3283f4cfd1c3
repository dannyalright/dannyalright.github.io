I"d<h2 id="goals">Goals</h2>
<p>This project began from a practical reason; much of the pledging experience on the apps were build on webviews that broke often. We had to remove webviews. So, we could have just done that by re-created all screens natively. But…</p>

<p>Our checkout UI had severe limitations:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The project page had to be compact to support the long, dense list of rewards</li>
  <li>The in-pledge experience for managing cards and chanign pledge was not intuitive</li>
</ul>

<p>Also, Kickstarter had formally organised itself to support flow-baesd teams. Teams like Rewards and Fulfillment, Backer Development, and Storytelling. Native could be a first-party platform like the web. A difficult task at an 10 year old internet company. Setting ourselves and our peers up for future platform changes through today’s UI had to be accounted for.</p>

<p>So thus our goals were:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Get rid of webviews</li>
  <li>Modernise the flow and interface</li>
  <li>Set us up for incoming Project and Pledge changes</li>
</ol>

<p>I found myself starved for interesting work, and made this project more ambituous then it needed to be.</p>

<p>Share the burden of tracking performance with others so that is a non-issue in the matter.</p>
