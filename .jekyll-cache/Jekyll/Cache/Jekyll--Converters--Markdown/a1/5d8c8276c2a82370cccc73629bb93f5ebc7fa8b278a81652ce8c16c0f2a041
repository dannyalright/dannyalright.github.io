I"p<p>Technology is a useful servant but a dangerous master.</p>

<p>Roger McNamee still owned (owns?) shares in Facebook as of writing this book.</p>

<p>Facebook had an opportunity to be the hero in their own story, similar to how Johnson &amp; Johnson handled the Tylenol incident. Their biggest fault lies not in the original overreach but rather in how they first responded to its ramifications.</p>

<p>This book’s purpose is to galvanise the reader to action; equip them with the tools to identify technology that takes advantage of users and their data.</p>

<p>The architecture of platforms like Facebook benefit conservative politics. Emotional posts become viral much easier than intellectual ones. Example: the emotional, nationalistic pro-leave Brexit campaign.</p>

<p>Facebook has become many countries’ public square—where people share ideas and form opinions. It has changed us from citizens to consumers.</p>

<p>McNamee: “I had been a Silicon Valley insider for more than 20 years”. Also McNamee, a few sentences after: “I did not realise then that the technology of Silicon Valley had ventured into uncharted technology”.</p>

<p>Facebook is a product of its time. It could not have been built in earlier Silicon Valley due to lacking infrastructure and services.</p>

<p>McNamee apparently wasn’t aware of anti-patterns (behavioural modification techniques that promote addiction) being used at Facebook until as late as 2017.</p>

<p>McNamee’s 7th Law: datasets become geometrically more valuable when you combine them.</p>

<p>Facebook’s advertising model made it compelling for content creators to place their content directly on Facebook (organic reach) rather than their own site. Facebook became the social hub of the web.</p>

<p>McNamee‘s band has had a Facebook page and Facebook advertising since early days. His insights therefore are multifaceted.</p>
