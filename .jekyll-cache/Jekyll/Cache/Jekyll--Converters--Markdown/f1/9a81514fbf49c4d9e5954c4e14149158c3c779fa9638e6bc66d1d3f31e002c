I"Ø<p>These three design studio exercises are intended to elicit tangible attributes for designing product whilst keeping multiple peopleâ€™s opinions heard and considered.</p>

<p>Credit to Chris Marotta from my time at ustwo for a lot of this. We worked on multiple projects together that made use of some or all parts. The photo examples below are from the <a href="https://growingupnyc.cityofnewyork.us">Growing Up NYC</a>â€”before it turned into the weird state it is in today.</p>

<h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2>

<ol>
  <li>An existing or in-process brand, product.</li>
  <li>Yourself and hopefully another designer as moderators.</li>
  <li>A group of participants (preferably stakeholders).</li>
  <li>A (roughly) shared view of aforementioned brand amongst said group of participants.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="method">Method</h2>

<p>Three design studio exercises that last about 20 minutes each. Try to do them sequentially and in the same session.</p>

<h3 id="1-metamorphosis">1. Metamorphosis</h3>

<p>Have every participant spend 2 minutes writing on post-it notes â€˜if this brand were X, it would be Yâ€™ for each of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Furniture</li>
  <li>Animal</li>
  <li>Brand</li>
  <li>Food &amp; drink</li>
  <li>Kids toy</li>
  <li>Location</li>
  <li>Personality</li>
  <li>Transport</li>
  <li>Texture</li>
</ul>

<p>The post-it notes can go up as they are created, or at the end of the 20 minutes. It depends on whether you want to encourage idea-riffing or encourage originality, respectively.</p>

      The results should look a little like this, minus the blue tape. Some of the attributes are 'hand made' (texture), 'reclining' (furniture), and 'diverse' (location).

<h3 id="2-organising-attributes">2. Organising attributes</h3>

<p>Spend a minute as a group observing and clarifying the results of the above. As moderators, take fresh post-it notes and cluster similar ideas into high-level themes. Confirm with participants and then make it real by naming each theme.</p>

<p>An example: post-it notes take from different categories such as â€˜warmâ€™, â€˜dependableâ€™, â€˜wiseâ€™, and â€˜role-modelâ€™ might be themed as â€˜Guiding Lightâ€™.</p>

<h3 id="3-creating-brand-attributes">3. Creating brand attributes</h3>

<p>For each of your new themes, and openly as a group, list attributes under the following areas:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Symbol</li>
  <li>Typography</li>
  <li>Photography</li>
  <li>Illustration</li>
  <li>Colour</li>
  <li>Motion</li>
  <li>Graphic forms</li>
  <li>Sound</li>
  <li>Language</li>
</ul>

<p>Attributes from the Metamorphosis exercises can be recycled.</p>

<p>Stop when you feel attribute additions slowing or becoming worse in quality. Use this as your cutting off pointâ€”play back the group-created attributes to the participants to seal the deal.</p>

<h2 id="next-steps">Next steps</h2>

<p>What you do after the above exercises varies for the desired output. For most visually-orientated outputs (brand identity, visual design) the next steps is often beginning moodboards informed by the brand attributes, separated by area.</p>
