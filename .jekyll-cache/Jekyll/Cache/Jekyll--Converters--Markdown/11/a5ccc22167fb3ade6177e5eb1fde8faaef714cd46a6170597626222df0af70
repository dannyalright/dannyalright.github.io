I"ò<p>Last Friday was my last day at ustwo. After a few years there, and a range of agency experiences elsewhere, Iâ€™ve decided to take a step away from client services.</p>

<p>ustwo was (and still is) a special place. Itâ€™s been gut-wrenching to leave. Some personal highlights:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The <a href="http://medium.com/offscreen-revisited/the-only-deep-true-interview-with-matt-mills-miller-co-founder-of-ustwo-7afe581b9931">fampany</a>. As much flack as we give the thing, it did feel like a big olâ€™ family</li>
  <li>Anaâ€™s empanadas</li>
  <li>Broken clocks, glass walls, and hoverboards</li>
  <li>Pecha Kuchas</li>
</ul>

<p>The structure of ustwo (fampany etc) and support of peers meant I had serious autonomy. Using LittleBits in the design process, augmenting a games team, and hosting Framer Sessions were all easy to do and encouraged. The flat nature of ustwo also forced some skills to develop I wouldnâ€™t have elsewhere.</p>

<p>Later this month Iâ€™ll be going in-house: joining the mobile team at Kickstarter. Feeling super fortunate to be able to do what I like, at a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/21/technology/kickstarters-altruistic-vision-profits-as-the-means-not-the-mission.html">public benefit corp</a>, on a platform with such a strong impact on the arts.</p>

<p>Much love to my ustwo family. This reel still holds up:</p>
