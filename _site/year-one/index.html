    <p>Hi Lex.</p>

    <p>Congrats to us on getting here. And a big thanks to you for your part in the last 365 days.</p>

    <p>I don‚Äôt think either of us expected to be where we are, one year + one day ago.</p>

    <p>We‚Äôve come from different places (9258 miles/14900 kilometers apart. <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=distance+between+sydney+and+new+port+richey">I looked it up</a>).</p>

    <p>That's kinda surreal when you think about it.</p>

    <p>What were the odds that we would have met, pre-NYC? Pretty slim. Probably close to zero.</p>

    <p>We come from hugely different backgrounds and were on separate paths. NYC brought us together but even still we could also much more likely have not met, even in the same city.</p>

    <p>We were going different directions.¬†</p>

    <p>Think about it though. Stop and look back for a second.</p>

    <p>We kind of <strong>were</strong> going the same direction. </p>

    <p>I really don't know about fate being real or not, and really couldn't care less either way.</p>

    <p>I do like to think though that we met at the perfect time to both elevate each other through a time of massive growth yet massive uncertainty.</p>

    <video src="videos/bike.mp4" autoplay loop muted playsinline></video>

    <p>We‚Äôve had our share of ups and downs. Probably more often and more intense than most people.</p>

    <p>You drive me crazy sometimes and I know I do the same to you.</p>

    <p>We are so in tune that we clash about the same things. We both have a massively high standard for each other because we know we are both better than our low points.</p>

    <p>We both have a non-stop work ethic. We're both stubborn as heck. We both go to bed early and are consistently the youngest people (by far) on walking tours.</p>

    <p>That's the beauty though. </p>

    <p>Us butting heads is us elevating one another. Our dynamic = great things to come. </p>

    <p>I have a feeling that we‚Äôre at a point where we‚Äôve hit a stride. Not a plateau, but a massive spike upwards. One going consistently upwards.</p>

    <p>We've had a crazy year.</p>

    <p>A challenging year.</p>

    <p>A great year.</p>

    <p><strong>And the best part about it is that it's only our first one.</strong></p>

    <p>I love you, Lex. I can't wait to see what we do in the year to come.</p>

    <p>Danny</p>

    <p>P.S. congrats on something else too. You are now the official owner/adoptee of:</p>

    <p>Seriously. You can <a href="http://www.unicode.org/consortium/adopted-characters.html#b1F469_200D_1F3ED">check it up here</a> and see the <a href="https://twitter.com/unicode/status/809825913101656064">official tweet here</a>. There's even a physical certificate on the way.</p>

    <p>We laugh about it, but it sums you up perfectly: a badass woman who not only holds her own but shows others how it's done.</p>

    <p>And you know how to weld.</p>
