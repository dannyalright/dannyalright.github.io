# [dannywhite.is](http://dannywhite.is/)
Hi. Welcome to my site. I'm keeping this open because 1. I'm too stingy to pay for GitHub and 2. I've put quite a lot of work into this that might be useful for others.

This site uses [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll) (actually all github.io sites do).

## Notable features
Things I've added onto or tweaked from the standard Jekyll theme, layouts, includes, etc:

- `image.html` include for inserting HTML `figure` elements, with automatic image directory handling
- `media-grid` include for inserting gridded media of any format, with editorial layouts as `type` to choose from
- auto-forwarding pages (e.g. [dannywhite.is/making](dannywhite.is/making))
- Open Graph in Jekyll
- Prettify URL slugs
- Extensive favicons
- Responsive `iframe` elements
- Using GitHub's project pages feature to publish from `repo-name` branch named `gh-pages` straight to `dannywhite.is/repo-name`

Almost all of these features are derived from other peoples' articles or examples. They will eventually have their origin attributed, and usage extrapolated here.
