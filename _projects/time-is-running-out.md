## Gist

Overview of project and it's impact.

## Process

It all started with a text message.

<img data-src="{{ site.url }}/assets/projects/time-is-running-out/message.png" alt="TODO">

Lexi and I were halfway through a [cross-country roadtrip](leaf-url) that was taking all of our attention.

## Inception

- [Pinterest](https://pin.it/ocszhdomrxblat)
  - I am a man

- Defining tone and messaging

- Paper sketches

- Figma sketches
  - Would have preferred not to; and just gone straight to Dan to hash it out, analog. Had to given the Sept 20 deadline and need to visualise on Kickstarter.
  - Kept it as short as possible and stressed the nature of change on Kickstarter

- Deciding feasible printing options
- Artwork for campaign, Instagram

## Going with letterpress

The Arm, specifically Dan who runs the join, was by far the most receptive and flexible.

## Printing

Paper was a snafu. So we went to print in two parts.

- More printing photos from later run(s)
- Car shot

## In retrospect

I don't regret the visual simplicity of the posters. Yes, we were too time and resource sconstrainted to do anyhting more intricateâ€”but the execution matches the message.

Perhaps we could have scouted similar efforts sooner, such as 350.org's art builds that were occuring weekends prior to the march.
