## Goals

This project began from a practical reason; much of the pledging experience on the apps were build on webviews that broke often. We had to remove webviews. So, we could have just done that by re-created all screens natively. But...

Our checkout UI had severe limitations:

- The project page had to be compact to support the long, dense list of rewards
- The in-pledge experience for managing cards and chanign pledge was not intuitive

Also, Kickstarter had formally organised itself to support flow-baesd teams. Teams like Rewards and Fulfillment, Backer Development, and Storytelling. Native could be a first-party platform like the web. A difficult task at an 10 year old internet company. Setting ourselves and our peers up for future platform changes through today's UI had to be accounted for.

So thus our goals were:

1. Get rid of webviews
2. Modernise the flow and interface
3. Set us up for incoming Project and Pledge changes

## How we did it

TBA

## In retrospect...

Things I would do differently had I the chance to do it over.

### Reflect more often on my own desires vs what's right for the team.

I found myself starved for interesting work, and made this project more ambituous then it needed to be.

### Ship less sooner.

Share the burden of tracking performance with others so that is a non-issue in the matter.
