Originally from Australia, I've been living and working in NYC for the last two years.

Right now my interests lie in prototyping and systems design. I'm also trying to figure out ways to tie my core competencies to environmentalism. I'm always open to speaking engagements and running prototyping sessions (Origami or Framer).

## Portfolio & CV
I try to keep a running deck of what I'm working on at [dannywhite.is/making][making]. It's private, meaning you'll need to request access before seeing its contents.

For my full CV, see [dannywhite.is/cv][cv]. Same deal there with request-access.
